# Common Table Expression (CTE)
- In SQL, a [Common Table Expression (CTE)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/cte-in-sql/) is an essential tool for simplifying complex queries and making them more readable. 
- By defining temporary result sets that can be referenced multiple times, a CTE in SQL allows developers to break down complicated logic into manageable parts. 
- CTEs help with hierarchical data representation, improve code reusability, and simplify maintenance.

# Benefits of Using CTEs in SQL

|                                | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Improved Readability**       | CTEs help break down complex queries into modular, reusable components, improving code readability and maintainability.                                          |
| **Reusability**                | Once defined, a CTE can be referenced multiple times within the same query, reducing the need for repetitive code.                                               |
| **Simplifies Complex Queries** | By using CTEs, especially recursive CTEs, complex operations like hierarchical data queries become much easier to manage.                                        |
| **Query Optimization**         | SQL engines can optimize queries that use CTEs more efficiently, improving performance, especially when the same result set needs to be accessed multiple times. |

# Limitations of CTEs in SQL

|                                            | Description                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temporary Scope**                        | A CTE exists only during the execution of the query. Once the query completes, the CTE is discarded.                    |
| **Performance Issues**                     | For very large datasets, CTEs can sometimes lead to performance degradation due to multiple references to the same CTE. |
| **Not Allowed in All Database Operations** | Some operations, such as INSERT and UPDATE, may have restrictions when using CTEs in certain databases.                 |
